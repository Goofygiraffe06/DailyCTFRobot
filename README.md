## About The Project

DailyCTF Robot is a Discord bot designed specifically for hosting and managing CTF challenges. It provides a seamless and streamlined experience for both organizers and participants, handling everything from the announcement of a challenge to the submission and validation of flags.

### Features

- **Dynamic bot presence**: The bot's activity status is heavily inspired from Cyberchef loading screen messages.
- **Role-based management**: Organizers can designate roles that can create or manage challenges, ensuring that the system remains tamper-proof.
- **Intuitive UI components**: The bot leverages Discord's UI components such as modals providing form like interface for users to create challenges and to setup.
- **Versatile command suite**: The bot includes commands for users (e.g., submitting flags, querying challenge time remaining) and admins (e.g., setting up and shutting down challenges, gathering feedback).
- **Feedback loop**: Users can provide feedback, after every submission creating a loop of feedback and continuous improvement.
- **Event logging**: All significant actions and interactions with the bot are logged for transparency and traceability.
- **Personalized on_guild message**: The bot introduces itself and provides essential guidelines when introduced to a new server.
- **Configurable settings**: Different servers can have different requirements, so the bot offers configurable settings for a tailored experience.
- **Security**: The bot has built-in security protocols, such as rigorous permission checks and safeguarding challenge answers.

### Under the Hood

The bot relies on a modular design, with each cog handling a specific set of tasks. This ensures maintainability and scalability. Keeping the primary logic clutter-free and comprehensible.
